# **👩🏻‍💻** What is Grit exactly?

## Title

***Company**, Location – (Dates)*

From Wikipedia:

In psychology, grit is a positive, non-cognitive trait based on an individual's perseverance of effort combined with the passion for a particular long-term goal or end state (a powerful motivation to achieve an objective). This perseverance of effort promotes the overcoming of obstacles or challenges that lie on the path to accomplishment and serves as a driving force in achievement realization. Distinct but commonly associated concepts within the field of psychology include "perseverance", "hardiness", "resilience", "ambition", "need for achievement" and "conscientiousness". These constructs can be conceptualized as individual differences related to the accomplishment of work rather than talent or ability. This distinction was brought into focus in 1907 when William James challenged the field to further investigate how certain individuals are capable of accessing richer trait reservoirs enabling them to accomplish more than the average person, but the construct dates back at least to Francis Galton, and the ideals of persistence and tenacity have been understood as a virtue at least since Aristotle.

Grit was defined as "perseverance and passion for long-term goals" by psychologist Angela Duckworth and colleagues, who extensively studied grit as a personality trait. They observed that individuals high in grit were able to maintain their determination and motivation over long periods despite experiences with failure and adversity. They concluded that grit is a better predictor of success than intellectual talent (IQ), based on their evaluation of educational attainment by adults, GPA among Ivy League undergraduates, dropout rate of cadets at West Point US Military Academy, and ranking in the National Spelling Bee.

# 🛠 Scales

## 💻 The data set included 3 tests and a set of about me questions.

This data was collected through an on-line personality test.

The first personality test was big five scales from the international personality item pool.

The following items were rated on a five point scale where 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree (0=missed). All were presented on one page.

1. I am the life of the party.
2. I am relaxed most of the time.
3. I feel little concern for others.
4. I am full of ideas.
1. Next came the Grit Scale test. There was 12 questions that were rated on a five point scale where 1=Very much like me, 2=Mostly like me, 3=Somewhat like me, 4=Not much like me, 5=Not like me at all:
    1. I have overcome setbacks to conquer an important challenge.
    2. New ideas and projects sometimes distract me from previous ones.
